# Dice Shaker
### Need to settle something by random choice? This is exactly what this does, with dice!
How it works:
- load up the game on a live server and click the button to determine which player will win
It's that easy :)

I created this as I was following along a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYwAEMedVdaRHwJ/). In this, we were given starting html and css files and coded the javascript on our own.
__Features I added:__
- instead of refreshing the page to determine a winner, I added a button
- linked the javascript function to that button to make it more user friendly
