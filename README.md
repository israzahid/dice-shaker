# Dice Shaker
### Need to settle something by random choice? This is exactly what this does, with dice!
How it works:
- Load up the game on a live server and click the button to determine which player will win
It's that easy :)

I created this as I was following along a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYwAEMedVdaRHwJ/). In this, we were given starting html and css files and coded the javascript on our own.

__Features I added:__
- Button to determine winner
⋅⋅⋅Tutorial would have to refresh the page⋅⋅
- Linked the javascript function to that button
⋅⋅⋅To make it more user friendly⋅⋅
